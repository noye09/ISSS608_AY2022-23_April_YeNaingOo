Welcome to my Quarto page!\n

I'm currently developing this page as part of my postgraduate studies for a Master of IT in Business at the SMU School of Information Systems. The purpose of this site is to showcase my visual analytics works, so please feel free to explore and let me know if you have any feedback or questions. Thank you for visiting!
